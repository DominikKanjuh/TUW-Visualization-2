    <p>
      This project was developed for the Visualization 2 (186.833) course at TU
      Wien during the Winter 2024 semester.

    <p>
      The project implements

    <h2>Project Details</h2>

    <h3>Data pipeline</h3>
    <p>
      Our data pipeline began with GeoTIFF (.tif) files which are a standard
      format for storing georeferenced raster images. We used GDAL (Geospatial
      Data Abstraction Library) a powerful translator library by the Open Source
      Geospatial Foundation to process these files. The workflow involved
      converting large GeoTIFF files into manageable tiles which we then
      transformed into SQL using raster2pgsql. These SQL files are then used to
      populate our PostGIS(PostgreSQL) database. The data is then returned by
      our backend which returns the stipples in a uniformly spaced grid,
      generated from normally distributed sample points within the bounded
      geographic frame.
    </p>

    <h3>Stippling algorithm implementation</h3>
    <p>
      At the core of our visualization is the Linde-Buzo-Gray (LBG) algorithm
      implementation. The algorithm starts with a set of points in a uniformly
      spaced grid. These points undergo an iterative refinement process where
      each point is moved to the centroid of its Voronoi region, weighted by the
      underlying density function (our geographic data). This process continues
      until convergence or a maximum number of iterations is reached, resulting
      in a distribution of points that effectively represents the density of the
      underlying data.
    </p>

    <h3>WebGPU visualization</h3>
    <p>
      For rendering we used WebGPU, a modern graphics API that provides
      high-performance 3D graphics and computation capabilities. Our
      implementation uses compute shaders for efficient point processing and
      rendering pipelines for smooth visualization. The WebGPU implementation
      allows us to handle thousands of stipple points in real-time, with dynamic
      updates as users adjust parameters or pan across the map. We've
      implemented features such as variable stipple sizes based on density,
      color mapping and interactive controls for adjusting the visualization
      parameters.
    </p>

    <h3>Interactive Features</h3>
    <p>
      The application provides a set of controls through its settings panel,
      allowing users to fine-tune various aspects of the visualization:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Adjustable fidelity controls for both X and Y dimensions</li>
      <li>Dynamic stipple size modification with density-based scaling</li>
      <li>Color customization for stipple points with start and stop color</li>
      <li>Real-time algorithm iteration visualization</li>
      <li>
        Multiple dataset selection (air pollution, temperature, earth relief,
        linear function...)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Documentation & Source Code</h2>
    <p>
      The complete source code documentation can be found at
      <a
        href="https://dominikkanjuh.github.io/TUW-Visualization-2/frontend/index.html"
        >https://dominikkanjuh.github.io/TUW-Visualization-2/frontend/index.html</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      The source code repository is available on GitHub at
      <a href="https://github.com/DominikKanjuh/TUW-Visualization-2"

    <h2>Project Structure</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>database/</code>: Contains the SQL files and initialization script
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>backend/</code>: Contains the backend code (Node.js and
        Express.js)
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>frontend/</code>: Contains the frontend code (TypeScript and
        WebGPU)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Running the Project</h2>
    <p>
      Each of the backend and frontend code has its own README file with
      instructions on how to run the code separately on your local machine.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note: Since the SQL files to populate the database were too large for
      GitHub, they've been stored on OneDrive. To download them, you can run the
      script <code>/database/download-sql.sh</code>
    </p>

    <p>
      For the simplest way to run the entire project (after downloading the sql
      files) you can use Docker Compose:
      <code>docker compose up --build</code>
    </p>
