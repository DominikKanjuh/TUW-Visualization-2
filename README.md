# Visualization 2 - Stippling of 2D Scalar Fields

This repository contains the project for the Visualization 2 (186.833) course at TU Wien during the Winter 2024 semester. The project implements [Linde-Buzo-Gray algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linde%E2%80%93Buzo%E2%80%93Gray_algorithm) for stippling of 2D Scalar fields, based on the research paper [Stippling of 2D Scalar Fields](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8667696) by GÃ¶rtler et al.
